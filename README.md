# xkcdpass: Generate a passphrase

![Password Strength by xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

# What it does

Passphrases are 4 words; adjective, noun, adverb, verb. I find this pattern produces phrases which are easier to remember/visualise than 4 completely random words as recommended by the xkcd comic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xkcdpass'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xkcdpass
